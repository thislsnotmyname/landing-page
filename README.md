# landing-page
This project's purpose is to create a landing page for a fake business for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).
This is to showcase beginner HTML and CSS skills, specifically Flexbox skills.

Though this project mentioned that the design was for a fake business, I spun it into a fake campaign website for an unnamed US election.
